						The Pokémon Abode - Early Years
					</header>
					<p>
						In 8th grade, I started a website about a videogame I loved - Pokémon. It flourished during the first dot-com-boom, partnering with IGN.com for sponsorship. As revenue rolled in, the site expanded with a webforum for thousands of members, sub-sites and staff. The site became one of the largest Pokémon sites on the internet. <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Abode" target="_blank">More info</a>

						The Pokémon Abode - The End
					</header>
					<p>
						 I was invited to the E3 videogame conference, and attended Nintendo's Pokémon summit where I spoke to the creators of the Pokémon franchise. But entering its 3rd year, revenue stopped and I had to close the site - it became a victim of the dot-com-bomb. However, the experience unlocked a creative and entreprenurial spirit.
